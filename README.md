## Important Pointers while creating a good technical resume

1. Add relevant details only. Recruiters don't have time to read jargon-full beautiful english.
2. Pointers must start with an action verb, you can find list of good action verbs [here](https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome). 
3. Try to keep text length same as document length i.e. your resume should look filled. Try to avoid whitespaces.
4. Avoid repetetions of action verbs and technical terms.
5. Try to add projects relevant to the role you are applying.
